"""Feature extraction from a radar volume, for either object family.

Every feature here is derived from *uncorrected* moments, because the gate ID
runs before correction. Nothing in this module may require a ``corrected_*``
field.

Field-name resolution
---------------------
Moment names are not stable across instruments or even across deployment years
of one instrument: BNF C-SAPR2 volumes from 2025 lack the ``uncorrected_``
variants that 2026 volumes carry. Each logical feature is therefore resolved
through an ordered preference list and the winning name is returned in the
metadata, so a field that has silently vanished is an auditable fact rather
than an all-NaN column nobody notices.

Ordering matters: the first match wins, so the shared portion of the Py-ART and
ODIM name lists must agree or the two object families would resolve different
fields from the same volume. A test enforces that.

    Parameters
    ----------
    moments : dict of str to ndarray
        Logical feature name -> 2-D array shaped (ray, gate). Keys follow
        :data:`FIELD_CANDIDATES`; missing moments are simply absent.
    gate_altitude : ndarray
        Gate altitude in metres above mean sea level, shaped like the moments.
    gate_range : ndarray
        Slant range in metres, broadcastable to the moment shape.
    nyquist : float, optional
        Nyquist velocity in m/s. Required for folding-aware velocity texture;
        without it the velocity features are omitted rather than computed
        wrongly.
    temperature : ndarray, optional
        Gate temperature in degrees Celsius. Strongly preferred over
        ``freezing_level_m`` alone.
    freezing_level_m : float, optional
        Height of the 0 degC level in metres MSL. Used for height-over-isotherm
        and, if ``temperature`` is absent, for a 6.5 K/km lapse-rate estimate
        that is flagged as such in the returned metadata.
    texture_window : int, optional
        Footprint, in gates and rays, of the texture operator.
