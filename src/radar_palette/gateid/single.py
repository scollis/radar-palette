"""Single-volume gate identification.

Per-gate classification of the dominant scatterer from polarimetric moments,
computed from a single radar volume with no reference to any other. This is the
memoryless baseline; :mod:`radar_palette.gateid.temporal` builds on it.

The classifier is intended for processing chains that identify gates *before*
correction, where the gate ID is not a diagnostic product but the control flow:
it selects which gates reach phase processing, attenuation correction, velocity
dealiasing and rainfall estimation. A defect here is silent and propagates.

Design decisions worth knowing
------------------------------
**Scores are normalised by attainable weight budget.** In a plain additive fuzzy
scheme a class can only win if the evidence it *could* muster is competitive.
Profiling an operational configuration on 4.75 million gates showed ``rain``
reaching at most 3.0 without a sounding while ``snow`` reached 4.0, so snow took
84% of gates above 40 dBZ in warm-season convection. No amount of
membership-function tuning fixes that; the budget itself is the bug.

**A class must have its evidence present to be eligible.** Budget normalisation
alone lets a class score a perfect 1.0 on two of five terms and tie one that
satisfied all of its own. See :data:`MIN_EVIDENCE_COVERAGE`.

**Gates with no positive evidence are ``unclassified``, never class zero.**
``argmax`` breaks ties toward index 0, silently.

**Phase coherence, not an arbitrary threshold, identifies incoherent echo.** A
magnetron randomises transmit phase pulse to pulse, so second-trip echo and
receiver noise both have radial velocity uniformly distributed over the Nyquist
interval, giving a texture of ``v_nyq/sqrt(3)``. See
:data:`INCOHERENT_TEXTURE_FRAC`.

    :func:`pyart.correct.calc_noise_floor` estimates a receiver noise level

    membership, so it composes with those rather than replacing them: if a

    Speckle outside the storm is mostly receiver noise that happens to land in

    ``snr_min``

    ``incoherent_frac``

        first-trip weather. This is what removes speckle that passes the SNR
        test, which the power-based cut alone cannot do.

    ``keep_dbz`` protects strong echo from both tests, so a bright core is

    Not a substitute for :func:`pyart.correct.despeckle_field`, and not a
    reimplementation of it. That function thresholds a *continuous* field,
    finds 2-D connected objects and returns a
    :class:`~pyart.filters.GateFilter` marking small ones for exclusion. This
    operates on the *categorical* class field after classification, dissolving
    short runs of one label surrounded by another, and returns labels rather
    than a mask. Both are useful; they answer different questions, and the
    Py-ART one is the right tool for speckle in reflectivity.

    An isolated one- or two-gate island of some class inside a different
    background is not a resolvable scatterer -- the pulse volume is larger than
    that -- so it is noise or a classifier artefact. Runs shorter than
    ``min_run`` are replaced by the neighbouring label where the neighbours
    agree, and by ``no_scatter`` otherwise.

    ``keep_mask`` protects gates that must never be dissolved regardless of run
    length. This matters: a two-gate 50 dBZ core at the edge of a cell is a real
    scatterer, and blanket despeckling removed 20% of gates above 30 dBZ on a
    BNF RHI before this guard existed. Callers should pass a reflectivity
    threshold mask.

    Operating along the range axis is deliberate: it is the axis with uniform,
    fine sampling in both PPI and RHI geometry, whereas the across-beam axis is
    azimuth in one and elevation in the other.

    Three speckle controls, applied in this order:

    ``snr_min``
        Gates below the minimum detectable signal become ``no_scatter``
        before the fuzzy scores are consulted. Set to ``None`` to disable.
    ``vel_texture_max``
        Absolute texture cut in m/s, if you want one. Normally leave this None
        and use ``incoherent_frac`` instead, which is PRF-independent.
    ``incoherent_frac``
        Velocity texture as a fraction of the uniform-random-phase limit
        v_nyq/sqrt(3), above which a gate is phase-incoherent and cannot be
        first-trip weather. This is the main speckle control; the SNR floor
        alone leaves incoherent gates that happen to carry power.
    ``min_run``
        After classification, runs shorter than this along the ray are
        dissolved. Requires ``shape``. Set to 1 to disable.
    ``despeckle_keep_dbz``
        Gates at or above this reflectivity are never dissolved, whatever the
